# Project Documentation

This project contains documentation for [WP Docker](https://github.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/). It is built using Retype, a static site generator for documentation.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
retype start
```

This will launch a local server where you can preview your documentation.

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation for production, run:

```bash
retype build
```

This will generate the static files in the `public` directory, ready to be deployed.
